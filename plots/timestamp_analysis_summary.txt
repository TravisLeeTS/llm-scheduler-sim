BURSTGPT TIMESTAMP & ARRIVAL RATE ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================================================

Dataset: 1,429,737 requests
Time Range: 5269973.00s (1463.88 hours)

INTER-ARRIVAL TIME STATISTICS:
  Mean: 3.686s
  Median: 1.000s
  Std Dev: 48.957s
  Min: 0.000000s
  Max: 15240.000s
  P95: 12.000s
  P99: 52.000s

ARRIVAL RATE (REAL TIMESTAMPS):
  Average: 0.271299 req/s
  Average: 16.2779 req/min
  Average: 976.68 req/hour

BURSTINESS (60s windows):
  Mean rate: 0.271298 req/s
  Peak rate: 20.833333 req/s
  Min rate: 0.000000 req/s
  Coefficient of Variation: 2.91
  Burst periods (>mean+2σ): 3.4%
  Quiet periods (<mean-σ): 0.0%

RPS SCALING COMPARISON (factor: 200.0x):
  Real duration: 1463.88 hours
  Scaled duration: 439.16 minutes
  Compression: 200.0x faster

  Real avg rate: 0.271299 req/s
  Scaled avg rate: 54.260 req/s
  Rate increase: 200.0x higher

KEY INSIGHTS:
  ✓ Real timestamps preserve natural bursty patterns from Azure production
  ✓ Arrival rate is very low (~0.2713 req/s), not high-pressure
  ✓ Burstiness exists but overall load is manageable
  ✓ RPS scaling creates artificial high-pressure for stress testing
  ✓ Real timestamps better for realistic benchmarking
  ✓ RPS scaling better for finding scheduler breaking points
