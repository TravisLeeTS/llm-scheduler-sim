BIN ASSIGNMENT EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS SUMMARY
============================================================

PREDICTION ACCURACY BY K:
  K= 2: Exact=53.3%, ±1 bin=100.0%
  K= 4: Exact=36.8%, ±1 bin=99.8%
  K= 8: Exact=15.3%, ±1 bin=47.3%
  K=16: Exact=6.2%, ±1 bin=24.0%
  K=32: Exact=3.3%, ±1 bin=10.7%

VARIANCE REDUCTION BY K:
  K= 1: 0.0% reduction
  K= 2: 27.1% reduction
  K= 4: 65.0% reduction
  K= 8: 81.0% reduction
  K=16: 87.9% reduction
  K=32: 91.3% reduction

BATCH TIME IMPROVEMENT BY K:
  K= 1: -1.7% improvement
  K= 2: 35.4% improvement
  K= 4: 51.6% improvement
  K= 8: 54.5% improvement
  K=16: 52.5% improvement
  K=32: 53.4% improvement

CONCLUSION:
K=4-8 bins optimal. Beyond 8 bins:
  - Prediction accuracy decreases (harder to hit exact bin)
  - Variance already ~80% reduced
  - Marginal batch time improvement <1%
